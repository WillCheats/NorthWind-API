## About Project

This project is developed as a team of 6, following agile methodologies, good programming practices in OOP, SOLID, design patterns, testing and logging. We created user stories on our [project board](https://trello.com/b/z01BitTz/boo-leans) to track our progess and ensure out focus remains on the tasks and requirements for the client.

Build a REST API for the Northwind Database with a MINIMUM of the following:

- A customers endpoint which lets you search for customers by name and find by ID
- A territories end point which shows a list of territories and all employees allocated to them
- An orders endpoint which shows me all orders between a date range
- A products endpoints which lets me change the unit price of a product from its ID
- A products endpoint which shows all products with their suppliers and categories

## **Project Management**

### <span style="color: blue;">**Planning**</span>

To plan the project, [Lo-ki Winners](https://trello.com/b/GpjkU09K/) started by creating user stories from the client requirements.
Trello was the kanban board of choice as it provided a useful user-friendly interface.

We made a quick trello board and added the requirements to it. We then wrote acceptance criteria for each user story, so that we each knew what we needed to do for the project.

The user stories where then assigned to either an individual or pair depending on difficulty and added to the user story card.

## Future Development

For future improvements we would like to implement a user-friendly UI to view the data.<br>
